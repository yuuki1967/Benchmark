 NOTE:
 Default port info:
 HTTPS port 9443, Shutdown port 8009

 -If these ports conflict, you need to modify them in server.html and pom.xml
 	./pom.xml
	./src/config/local/server.html
 	./src/config/remote/server.html

 -Once you change them, the operation "mvn compile" is required.

 -If CxSAST is running on the same PC, you need to change the shutdown port on server.xml for CxARM. Because you can not change one for Benchmark.
